However, some patchy rain likely along coasts and hills in the northwest. Into mid-week, the south and southeast are likely to remain dry, but the far north and west probably seeing rain at times, which may extend a little further south and east with time. Further into the period, a transition away from higher pressure in the south allows for more unsettled conditions to become widespread across the UK. Temperatures generally mild, although potentially cold in the south overnight, especially earlier in the period."

Bands of rain and strong winds are expected, especially in the northwest, with a risk of some wintry showers in the intervening colder brighter interludes between these frontal systems. Some of these frontal systems perhaps spreading further to the southeast, although much of the south and southeast will likely be relatively drier. Confidence in the forecast around the turn of the month becomes much lower, and whilst the more likely scenario is one of a continuation of similar conditions experienced through the latter half of February, there is a low probability of some much colder weather developing."
